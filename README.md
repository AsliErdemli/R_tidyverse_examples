# R Tidyverse use examples
These 3 R scripts are examples of how R tidyverse can be used to deal with raw data, which, in this example, is downloaded from Gorilla, the experiment builder. 
- The data can be QC visually and statistically for each participant to screen for bots (see Analysis0.R)
- The data, issued from multiple csv files referring to different Gorilla versions and tasks, can be binded together and transformed into full data design sets (see Analysis1.R)
- The data can be averaged across all participants, time-series plotted + visually explored via various plots (boxplots, violinplots, heatmaps etc.) (See Analysis 2.R)
